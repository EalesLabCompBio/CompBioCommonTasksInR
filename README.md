# R code solutions for common computational biology tasks

## Summary
A repository of code examples (with explanation) on real world data files from computational biology using the [`data.table`](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table) and [`ggplot2`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/index.html) R packages. I think `data.table` is perfect for computational biology tasks of all sizes. I also think `ggplot2` is awesome for building intuitive visualisations of your data. Here I provide working code examples of how I do useful tasks with computational biology data using `data.table` and `ggplot2`. This is in no way intended to be 'best-practice' or 'expert' code, these are example solutions to common tasks for people new to R and data.table. I have deliberately simplified some examples to aid clarity.

## How to use
This GitHub repository is an Rstudio project, download it all as a zip or clone it using 'git' on the command line.

## Steps to success
1. Start with [`introduction.R`](introduction.R)
2. Have a look at the different tasks, each one is a separate R code file.
3. Have a go at completing the code for the student tasks (1-4).
4. Maybe also look at the [basics of data.table file](basics-of-data-table.R), for more detail on the "how" and "why" and the "special" variables of data.table.
5. Write your own code for the 'contributed' section and submit a pull request.

## December 2023 - status
* We are recording YouTube video companions for each task, video link is available in the R source code for each task - these videos are currently unlisted.
* Videos are being migrated to new YouTube Channel

## March 2022 - Status
* First release of the student tasks 1-3 written.
* First release of the introduction and basics code are written.
* First release of tasks 1-5 are written.
* All other tasks are just placeholders.
