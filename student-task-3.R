#Student task 3. How many genes are eGenes on each chromosome and can you plot it?

#Write code that implements the steps outlined below

#Step 1 - load the data.table and ggplot2 R packages

#Step 2 - load the eGenes file ("Kidney_Cortex.v8.egenes.txt.gz") as a data.table 
#and assign it to a new variable, choose an informative variable name

#Step 3 - group the data by chromosome and calculate the number of genes tested
#and the number of statistically significant eGenes
#Hint - look at task 4 for grouping, student-task 1 for how to determine 
#statistical significance and basics-of-data-table on how to count rows within a group

#Step 4 - Calculate the perecentage of tested genes which are eGenes for each chromosome
#Hint - create a new column in the table you created for step 3

#Step 5 - Use ggplot2 to generate a bar plot of the number of genes tested per chromosome
#Step 5 / extra credit - can you display the chromosome in the correct order?

#Step 6 - Use ggplot2 to generate a plot of the number of eGenes per chromosome
#Step 6 / extra credit - can you display the chromosome in the correct order?

#Step 7 - Use ggplot2 to generate a plot of the percentage of tested genes which are 
#eGenes per chromosome
#Step 7 / extra credit - can you display the chromosome in the correct order?
