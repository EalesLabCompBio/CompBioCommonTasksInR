#Student task 2. What is the mean, median, standard deviation, maximum and minimum number of eSNPs per eGene?

#Write code that implements the steps outlined below

#Step 1 - load the data.table and ggplot2 R packages

#Step 2 - load the significant pairs file ("Kidney_Cortex.v8.signif_variant_gene_pairs.txt.gz") as a data.table 
#and assign it to a new variable, choose an informative variable name

#Step 3 - calculate the number of eSNPs per eGene in the significant pairs file

#Step 4 - summarise the values from step 3 by calculating the minimum, median, mean, maximum and standard deviation of
#eSNPs per eGene

#Step 5 - plot the distribution of numbers of eSNPs per eGene using a ggplot2 density plot

#Step 6 - add vertical lines to the plot from step 5 to denote the location of the median and mean number of eSNPs per 
#eGene
