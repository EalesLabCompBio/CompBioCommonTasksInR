#Student task 1. How many genes are eGenes on chromosome 1? 

#Write code that implements the steps outlined below

#Step 1 - load the data.table R package

#Step 2 - load the eGenes file ("Kidney_Cortex.v8.egenes.txt.gz") as a data.table and assign it to a new variable
#choose an informative variable name

#Step 3 - print the first 5 lines of the table
#so you can inspect the column names and kinds of data in each column

#Step 4 - subset the rows in the table to select only those genes on chromosome 1
#and assign this to a new variable with an informative name

#Step 5 - print the number of genes tested on chromosome 1

#Step 6 - print the number of statistically significant eGenes on chromosome 1
#hint use the "qval" column
